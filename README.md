## Abstract

In this workshop you will learn the fundamentals of deep learning using Tensorlfow 2.0 machine learning library. We will build two deep learning models: an image classifier using computer vision and a movie review classifier using natural language processing. This workshops works for people, who have used a different deep learning library before and want to learn the basics of Tensorflow 2.0 as well as machine learning engineers, data scientists and Python developers, who want to learn the fundamentals of deep learning using the latest technologies.
